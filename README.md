# Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a structured practice of 100 core algorithms,
implemented from scratch to build strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills.

The focus is on understanding **how and why** an algorithm works, not just writing code.

## Structure

Algorithms are organized by difficulty and concept:

- **01_Basic_Logic_and_Control_Flow**
- **02_Arrays_and_Iteration**
- **03_Searching_and_Sorting**
- **04_Strings_and_Patterns**
- **05_Recursion_and_Problem_Solving**
- **06_Real_World_Logic_Problems**

Each folder contains individual algorithm implementations with clear naming
and incremental complexity.

## Goals

- Strengthen core programming logic
- Improve problem decomposition skills
- Build confidence for coding interviews
- Develop consistency through daily practice

---

## Language

- C (primary)
- Python (later for comparison and optimization)

---

## Notes

- One algorithm per file
- Emphasis on clarity and correctness
- No copy-paste from tutorials

This repository reflects my learning journey and continuous improvement.
